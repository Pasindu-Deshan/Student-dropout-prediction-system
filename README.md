# Student-dropout-prediction-system
The issue of student dropout from a study program is complex and requires proactive measures to mitigate
it. Identifying the factors that contribute to dropouts and predicting student outcomes can empower
educational institutions to implement timely interventions and support mechanisms. This report introduces
the "Student Dropout Prediction System," which is a data-driven approach aimed at foreseeing potential
student dropouts by using advanced machine learning models.<be><br><be><br>
The primary objective of the Student Dropout Prediction System is to leverage predictive analytics to
identify students at risk of dropping out of their study programs. By using various sets of student-related
parameters, this system aims to provide educational institutions with actionable insights, enabling them to
intervene on time and offer personalized support to students facing challenges.<be><br><be><br>
Predicting student dropout is complex due to the varied and nuanced factors influencing this decision.
Different neural network architectures can be considered suitable with some strengths and weaknesses for
this specific problem. Among them, one of the suitable neural network architectures to address this problem
is Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. A Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) is a type of deep neural network that uses its internal memory with loops to process
sequence data. The architecture of RNNs also forms the basic structure of LSTMs. In an RNN, a hidden
layer receives an input vector and generates an output vector. RNNs are known for their ability to adapt and
predict nonlinear time series problems. LSTMs excel at handling temporal dependencies within student
data, where past behaviour or performance can influence dropout risk. RNNs and LSTMs are well-suited
for sequential data, making them applicable to time-series aspects of student performance data. LSTMs are
effective in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, which can be crucial for
understanding the progression of a student's academic journey. (Gaafar, Dahr, & Hamoud, 2021)<be><br><be><br>
Some research suggests creating a drop-out prediction model using a Recursive Neural Network (RNN)
with GRU units. GRU is a gating mechanism in RNNs, and GRU-RNNs are a well-known type of
traditional RNNs. Compared to Long short-term memory (LSTM), another well-known variant of RNN,
GRU has fewer parameters, which means less computation is required. However, LSTM has a more
complex memory cell structure than GRU. It includes a cell state that allows for better control over the flow
of information. For larger datasets and tasks that require the modelling of intricate sequential dependencies,
LSTM might be more suitable. Also, RNN with LSTM is excellent at capturing temporal dependencies in
data, making it ideal for analyzing sequential student activity or performance. (Sun, et al., 2019)
